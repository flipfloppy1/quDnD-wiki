        <b>Summary</b>
        <p>
          In Qud, skills are a primary source of build diversity and utility for
          both mutants and true kin. Their closest DnD equivalent is Feats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Skills range from techniques used in combat, to mechanics
          like tinkering, cooking, butchering and gathering.
        </p>
        <b>Skill Points</b>
        <p>
          Skills can be purchased with Skill Points, which are granted on level-up.
          <a (click)="nav('/concept/true kin')">True Kin</a> gain a base 3 Skill Points
          per level, whilst <a (click)="nav('/concept/mutants')">Mutants</a> gain 2. If your
          intelligence modifier is two or greater, your number of Skill Points per
          level is increased by half your Intelligence modifier, rounded down, retroactively
          applied to any previous levels too. This ensures that if you gain more intelligence
          later, you don't miss out on the Skill Points you would've gained from having that
          intelligence earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a level 5 True Kin with an Intelligence of 13 (INT Mod +1) were
          to invest an attribute point into Intelligence, they would immediately
          gain 5 Skill Points from the five levels prior. Because of the INT bonus,
          on their next level up they would receive 4 instead of 3 Skill Points.
        </p>
        <b>Learning From NPCs</b>
        <p>
          Certain NPCs can teach skills when you water ritual with them, for a reputation cost
          equal to the skill points required to learn it. See <a (click)="nav('/concept/reputation')">Reputation</a>
          for more on how that works.

        <b>Summary</b>
        <p>
          Mutant, or mutated human, is one archetype available at character creation, the
          other option being <a (click)="nav('/concept/true kin')">True Kin</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mutants use mutations as their primary means of build diversity, and don't have
          access to <a (click)="nav('/concept/cybernetics')">cybernetics</a>. Mutations are
          purchased and upgraded using mutation points (MP). The rank of a mutation is
          sometimes referred to as MUT.
        </p>
        <b>Mutations and Mutation Points</b>
        <p>
          At character creation, mutants get 12 MP to spend on mutations, which don't carry
          over to play. Mutants gain 1 MP on every level up. Some mutations have a greater
          initial cost than others, and most mutations can be upgraded after they are acquired to
          enhance their effects, with the exception of 1 MP mutations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mutations are split into five categories: morphotypes, physical mutations, physical defects,
          mental mutations and mental defects. Taking mental or physical defects at character creation
          gives you more mutation points to spend on other mutations.
        </p>
        <p>
          At any point during a campaign, a mutant can expend 4 mutation points to gain
          a new mutation. The player gets to choose from 1 of 3 randomly rolled mutations.
        </p>
        <b>
          Morphotypes
        </b>
        <p>
          There are three mutations in the morphotypes category, which can only be selected at character creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span (click)="nav('/mutation/chimera')" class="mut-link">

            <a>Chimera</a>
          </span>
          is a morphotype that causes the player to only manifest physical mutations. It is incompatible with any
          mental mutations at character creation, and the mutations the player can select from when manifesting
          a new mutation will be restricted to physical mutations during the campaign. Additionally, whenever the
          player manifests a new mutation, one of the three choices will allow them to grow a randomly placed limb.

            <a>Esper</a>
          </span>
          is a morphotype that causes the player to only manifest mental mutations. Whilst mental mutations are very
          powerful, their power is often coveted by other, mysterious beings... A player's Glimmer is the sum of
          the mutation ranks of all their mental mutations. Who knows what could happen if they shine too bright?

            <a>Unstable Genome</a>
          </span>
          is the only mutation that can be bought more than once. Each time you buy it,
          you get one extra mutation that has a 1/3 chance to manifest on level up (5 or 6 on a d6), in the
          same way that buying a random mutation would. The player's stacks of

          </span>
          decrease by one every time they manifest a new mutation this way, until there are no more stacks left.
          This morphotype has a chance to give you access to 4 or 5 point mutations that you may not have otherwise
          been able to buy, and also allows you to grow more limbs as a

          There is a lot of bespoke terminology and concepts in the world of Qud.

        <p>
          Since explaining them has already been done beforehand (and a lot better than I can), I refer to the following articles from the original game's wiki. They contain
          knowledge that would be universally known to any resident of Qud one decides to play. Keep in mind that a few video game-specific things may differ in quDnD.

          Be sure not to stray too far from these articles; a lot of other content and mechanics have been adapted to fit the TTRPG format and aren't
          consistent with the game's wiki. For instance, the Attributes and Modifiers section, and the Combat section at the end of the Game Concepts
          article aren't relevant to quDnD.

        <b>Summary</b>
        <p>
          As the party explores the vast jungles of Qud, many different factions start to
          become invested in them, for better or for worse. There are a number of factors
          that influence reputation, and a number of things that reputation influences.
        </p>
        <b>The Scale</b>
        <p>
          Reputation ranges from -24 to 24. With a reputation of -24 or lower towards a faction, even
          passive members of the faction will be hostile towards the party, whereas with a reputation
          of 24 or higher, even aggressive members of the faction will be friendly towards the party.
          Friendly NPCs will notice when allies are attacked in an area, and support them if they are
          able to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some factions have sacred spaces, where they may act differently if you encroach upon them.
          If the party enters the sacred space of a faction without being at least liked by the faction,
          the inhabitants will be hostile towards the party.
        </p>
        <b>Water Ritual</b>
        <p>
          The water ritual is a universally recognised sacred rite of Qud, where due to its scarcity,
          fresh water is a precious commodity. The water ritual can be opened with a non-hostile Legendary NPC.
          A representative of the party will state "Your thirst is mine, my water is yours", offering
          a dram of fresh water, or another liquid the NPC prefers (such as oil for some robots).
        </p>
        <p>
          Killing an NPC that the party is water-bonded with breaks the sacred covenant, and reduces the party's
          reputation in every faction by 4 + 1d4 points.
        </p>
        <b>Legendary NPCs</b>
        <p>
          In Qud, Legendary NPCs exist that are representatives of their faction or tribe.
          For each Legendary NPC, there may be a number of factions that like, love, dislike
          or hate the Legendary NPC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slaying a Legendary NPC will increase your reputation with factions that hate or dislike them,
          and decrease your reputation with their faction and factions that like or love them. Performing the
          water ritual with them will do the opposite.
